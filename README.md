# Ionic Tour Of Heroes

This is an example project to show how to add the [Ionic framework](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework) to an existing Angular project. Ionic is describe as "an open source app development toolkit for building modern, fast, top-quality cross-platform native and Progressive Web Apps from a single codebase with JavaScript and the Web" and I can't tell you enough about how easy it can make app development when native code is needed for things like the camera.

First, and this is where the project is currently at, I followed the [Angular Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes) tutorial to have an existing Angular app to begin with.

Next, we will add the functionality of the device camera to the app to take photos of our heroes.
